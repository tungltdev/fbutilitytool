PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our Extension.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What personal information do we collect from the people that use the FB Utility Tool  extension?
</span><br>We DO NOT collect any Personally identifiable Information. We only collect extension usage statistics to help improve user experience. If you want to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">When do we collect information?
</span><br>We collect usage statistics when a feature of FB Utility Tool is used. We only collect PII (your name) when you directly message us for customer support to allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests, and to follow up with you after correspondence (Facebook Chat).
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do we use extension usage statistics?
</span><br>We use extension usage statistics in the following way:
                <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • To see which feature most users use.
                <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • To improve our extension in order to better serve you.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do we protect your information?
</span><br>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.
                <br>We only provide exclusive features to improve Facebook using experience. We never ask for credit card numbers.
                <br>We again do not store or collect any user information.
                <br>
                <br>Your personal information is contained behind Browser's Local Storage and is only accessible by yourself. In addition, when you log out of Facebook, Local Storage is cleared so that no other person can access.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do we use 'cookies'?
</span><br>We use cookies to make the whole extension functioning.
                <br>
                <br>Instead of having users to log in or log out, we use cookies. Also, most features from FB Utility Tool use those Facebook APIS that require cookies. However, no cookies are collected!
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third-party disclosure
</span><br>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third-party links
</span><br>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
</span><br>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
</span><br>It's also important to note that we collect extension usage statistics to help improve user experience. If you want to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">California Online Privacy Protection Act
</span><br>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
</span><br>Users can visit our site anonymously.
                <br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
                <br>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
                <br>
                <br>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
                <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • On our Privacy Policy Page
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
</span><br>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
                <br>
                <br>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fair Information Practices
</span><br>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
</span><br>We will notify you via email within 1 business day
                <br>
                <br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                <br>
                <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CAN SPAM Act</span><br>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
                <br>However, we DO NOT collect your email address
                <br>
